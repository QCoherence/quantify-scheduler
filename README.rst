quantify-scheduler
==================

The Quantify Scheduler is a toolchain for writing quantum programs. It is designed for experimentalists to easily define
complex experiments, and produces synchronized pulse schedules to be distributed to control hardware.

It is a part of the `Quantify OS project`_.

.. _Quantify OS project: https://gitlab.com/quantify-os

Features
--------

- Define procedures at the level of quantum Gates, arbitrary Pulses or a combination of the two
- Resource management
- Hardware independent internal representation
- Multiple frontends and backends
