    - Future TODO: finish automation of this step in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

    ```bash

    VERSION_PART=patch # or minor, or major
    bump2version $VERSION_PART --config-file setup.cfg
    ```

    ```bash
    NEW_TAG=#Switch to the latest bumped version
    echo $NEW_TAG
    mv ./frozen_requirements/frozen-requirements.txt ./frozen_requirements/frozen-requirements-$NEW_TAG.txt
    git add ./frozen_requirements/frozen-requirements-$NEW_TAG.txt
    git commit -m "Add pip frozen requirements for $NEW_TAG"
    ```

    - [ ] Create a new tag based on the version number in gitlab (https://gitlab.com/quantify-os/quantify-scheduler/-/tags/new).
