    """
    Main function driving the compilation. The principle behind the overall compilation
    works as follows:

    For every instrument in the hardware configuration, we instantiate a compiler
    object. Then we assign all the pulses/acquisitions that need to be played by that
    instrument to the compiler, which then compiles for each instrument individually.

    This function then returns all the compiled programs bundled together in a
    dictionary with the QCoDeS name of the instrument as key.

    Parameters
    ----------
    schedule
        The schedule to compile. It is assumed the pulse and acquisition info is
        already added to the operation. Otherwise an exception is raised.
    hardware_cfg
        The hardware configuration of the setup.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        The compiled schedule.
